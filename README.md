## About
The project is a stock exchange trading registration system that is being developed with the possibility of registering new trades, including, they will be imported from specialized services in new features. All applying the object oriented paradigm. This project allowed me to apply ES6 features in addition to organizing it into the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, learning design patterns, programming asynchronously with promises, rendering templates and more.
